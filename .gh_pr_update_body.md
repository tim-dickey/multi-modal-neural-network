Dependency bump: upgrade PyTorch to >=2.8.0 (CVE-2025-32434 mitigation)

Summary
- Bumps `torch` requirement to `>=2.8.0` in `requirements.txt` and `pyproject.toml` to mitigate CVE-2025-32434 (unpickling RCE in older torch versions).
- Adds a defensive loader `src/utils/safe_load.py` exposing `safe_load_checkpoint()` which:
  - Prefers `safetensors` for `.safetensors` files when `safetensors` is installed.
  - Falls back to `torch.load` with validation that the loaded object is a dict and expected keys are present.
  - Accepts `map_location` and optional `expected_keys` for runtime checks.
- Replaced direct `torch.load` call sites in:
  - `src/training/trainer.py` (resume/load checkpoint)
  - `src/models/multi_modal_model.py` (pretrained weight loading)
  - `inference.py` example
- Trainer checkpointing now still writes the legacy `.pt` checkpoint (non-breaking) and attempts to write a best-effort `model_state_dict` `.safetensors` copy when `safetensors` is available.
- Documentation updates: `TRAINING_GUIDE.md` and `docs/NPU_TRAINING.md` updated to prefer `state_dict()` + `.safetensors` patterns and show `safe_load_checkpoint` usage.

Recent updates (security hardening)
- Added runtime path guards to `src/utils/safe_load.py` to refuse remote URLs and restrict loads to repository or system tempdir by default. Added `allow_external` to opt out when necessary.
- Added unit tests `tests/test_safe_load.py` for non-dict checkpoint rejection, missing expected-keys, and safetensors roundtrip (skips if `safetensors` not installed).
- Hardened PowerShell probing in `src/utils/npu_utils.py` to check for PowerShell availability and use `-NoProfile -NonInteractive` flags and a static command list.

Tests
- Ran full test suite locally: `pytest -q` -> 84 passed (10.7s). The new safe_load tests passed locally.

Codacy
- Attempted to run the Codacy CLI analyze via the MCP tool from the agent, but the MCP Codacy tool is currently disabled/unavailable. Per repository guidance, the Codacy analysis must be run after edits; CI will run Codacy checks on the pushed branch — please review the GitHub Actions run for Codacy artifacts and findings.

Next steps
- If you want, I can add explicit unit tests for the `allow_external` behavior and/or propagate an `allow_external` flag from any CLI/user-facing loader functions. I can also configure CI to install `safetensors` so the safetensors roundtrip is exercised in PR checks.

If you'd like, I can also add a short PR checklist and request reviewers or labels. Let me know your preferences.

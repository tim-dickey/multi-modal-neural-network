Dependency bump: upgrade PyTorch to >=2.6.0,<3 (CVE-2025-32434 mitigation)

Summary
- Bumps `torch` requirement to `>=2.6.0,<3` in `requirements.txt` and `pyproject.toml` to mitigate CVE-2025-32434 (unpickling RCE in older torch versions).
- Adds a defensive loader `src/utils/safe_load.py` exposing `safe_load_checkpoint()` which:
  - Prefers `safetensors` for `.safetensors` files when `safetensors` is installed.
  - Falls back to `torch.load` with validation that the loaded object is a dict and expected keys are present.
  - Accepts `map_location` and optional `expected_keys` for runtime checks.
- Replaced direct `torch.load` call sites in:
  - `src/training/trainer.py` (resume/load checkpoint)
  - `src/models/multi_modal_model.py` (pretrained weight loading)
  - `inference.py` example
- Trainer checkpointing now still writes the legacy `.pt` checkpoint (non-breaking) and attempts to write a best-effort `model_state_dict` `.safetensors` copy when `safetensors` is available.
- Documentation updates: `TRAINING_GUIDE.md` and `docs/NPU_TRAINING.md` updated to prefer `state_dict()` + `.safetensors` patterns and show `safe_load_checkpoint` usage.

Tests
- Ran local test suite: `pytest -q` -> 81 passed (10.5s). Test logs show trainer saving `.safetensors` when available.

Rationale
- Upgrading PyTorch provides immediate mitigation for the CVE; the centralized `safe_load_checkpoint()` and optional `.safetensors` writes reduce future unpickling attack surface and give users a clear migration path.

Notes & Next Steps
- Codacy CLI analyze could not be run locally via the MCP tool (disabled in the agent). CI will run and Codacy checks will run in GitHub Actions on push; please review the Actions run for the Codacy artifacts and any security findings.
- Suggested follow-ups:
  1. Audit any remaining `torch.load` call sites (3rd-party scripts or user notebooks) and update them to prefer `state_dict`/`.safetensors` where possible.
  2. Consider adding an explicit runtime guard (e.g., refuse to load non-`state_dict` `.pt` files from untrusted paths without a config flag).
  3. If you want, I can add unit tests to explicitly exercise `safe_load_checkpoint` with real `.safetensors` (when `safetensors` is present) and with invalid inputs to ensure validations.

If you'd like, I can also add a short PR checklist and request reviewers or labels. Let me know your preferences.
